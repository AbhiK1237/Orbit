### Day 10: Demo Scenario 1 - Flight Booking
**Goals**: Implement complete flight booking workflow
**Tasks**:
- Define flight booking task decomposition
- Implement web scraping for flight comparison sites
- Create form filling automation for booking
- Add price comparison logic
- Test end-to-end booking process (without actual payment)

### Day 11: Demo Scenario 2 - Price Comparison
**Goals**: Build e-commerce price comparison feature
**Tasks**:
- Implement product search across multiple sites
- Create price extraction and comparison logic
- Add real-time price monitoring capabilities
- Build result aggregation and formatting
- Test with popular products across 3-4 sites

### Day 12: Demo Scenario 3 - Document Processing
**Goals**: Complete document analysis workflow
**Tasks**:
- Implement PDF upload and processing
- Create document summarization pipeline
- Add Q&A functionality with uploaded documents
- Build report generation features
- Test with various document types

### Day 13: Integration & Error Handling
**Goals**: Polish all components and add robust error handling
**Tasks**:
- Integrate all demo scenarios into single interface
- Implement comprehensive error handling across all agents
- Add logging and monitoring capabilities
- Create fallback mechanisms for failed tasks
- Test failure recovery scenarios

### Day 14: Final Testing & Demo Preparation
**Goals**: Final testing, optimization, and demo preparation
**Tasks**:
- Conduct end-to-end testing of all features
- Optimize performance and response times
- Create demo scripts and test data
- Record demo videos of key functionalities
- Prepare documentation and deployment guide

## Daily Work Schedule Recommendation

### Morning (4-5 hours):
- Core development tasks
- Complex problem-solving
- New feature implementation

### Afternoon (3-4 hours):
- Integration work
- Testing and debugging
- Documentation

### Evening (1-2 hours):
- Planning next day
- Research and learning
- Code review

## Critical Success Milestones

### End of Week 1:
- ✅ Camel-AI multi-agent system working
- ✅ Basic browser automation functional
- ✅ Document processing operational
- ✅ Agent coordination established

### End of Week 2:
- ✅ Chat interface fully functional
- ✅ 3 demo scenarios working end-to-end
- ✅ Error handling and recovery implemented
- ✅ System ready for demonstration

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Behind Schedule:
- Focus on one demo scenario instead of three
- Use simpler UI (command line instead of web interface)
- Implement hard-coded workflows instead of dynamic task planning
- Skip advanced error handling for MVP

### If Ahead of Schedule:
- Add more sophisticated intent classification
- Implement additional demo scenarios
- Enhance UI with better design
- Add voice input/output capabilities

## Key Dependencies & Blockers

### Technical Dependencies:
- Camel-AI framework stability
- Playwright browser automation reliability
- Website structure compatibility for scraping
- LLM API availability and rate limits

### Potential Blockers:
- Anti-bot measures on target websites
- Complex authentication flows
- Rate limiting from external services
- Agent coordination complexity

## Success Metrics for MVP

### Functional Metrics:
- 3 complete demo scenarios working
- <10 second response time for simple queries
- 80% success rate for browser automation
- Basic error recovery in place

### User Experience Metrics:
- Intuitive chat interface
- Clear progress indication
- Meaningful error messages
- Smooth demo presentation

This plan focuses on building a working prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition while being realistic about what can be achieved in 2 weeks.
